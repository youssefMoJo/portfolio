          Hi, I'm Youssefâ€”a dedicated full-stack web developer and enthusiastic
          content creator. You'll often find me crafting engaging shorts on
          Facebook and Instagram, driven by a passion for exploring the
          intersection of technology and its potential to enhance our daily
          lives. Whether I'm immersed in coding or sharing insights on the
          profound impact of technology, I thrive on deepening my understanding
          and cultivating knowledge in every endeavor.
        </p>

          As a Train-the-Trainer Facilitator with techKNOWtutors at CSCNL since
          January 2024, I actively create curriculum and conduct workshops,
          empowering individuals with crucial digital skills in Newfoundland.
          Additionally, I collaborate with nonprofits and volunteers to secure
          the sustainability of digital skills initiatives, extending the impact
          far beyond the scope of techKNOWtutors.
